==Storybro's Magically Lewd Sleepover Adventure: Visual Novel Edition==

This is the main page for the visual novel adaptation. We are currently looking for artists; both background and character.

To use this project in [Ren'Py](www.renpy.org), just clone this project to your projects folder. This is usually `Documents/Ren'Py/` or `Documents/Ren'Py/renpy-[version]-sdk`. In Linux-style commands:

```
cd ~/Documents/Ren'Py/
git clone https://github.com/snoozbuster/Storybro-VN
```

In Windows, you can download something like [MinGW](mingw.org) or [Cygwin](www.cygwin.com) to give you a Linux-like terminal. You can also use the [GitHub for Windows](http://windows.github.com) client.

To contribute, add files you've made to the `game/` folder and make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).
